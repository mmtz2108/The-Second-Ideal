    <p>My name is Marcos Martinez and this is my first attempt at a personal website. As the years go on I will update
        this as I become more experienced. Welcome and thank you for being here.</p>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program. My hobbies include reading,
        golf, acting, football, and film. Additionally, I am an aspiring actor as well.
        Here is a link to <a href="https://youtu.be/hpXn6tZ3m0Q">my demo reel</a>. Feel free to take a look and let me
        know what you think.

    <p>If you're wondering why the name of my website includes the words, "The Second Ideal", it has to do with my
        current favorite book series I'm reading called the Stormlight Archive. It's a story of budding heroes who bond
        "spren" to become a part of an order of the Knights Radiant. The Knights Radiant were an ancient mythical class
        of heroes with incredible powers. Wonderfully, you can take a <a
            href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/official-knights-radiant-order-quiz/">quiz</a> curated by the author
        of the series to see what order of Knights Radiant you are. I, myself, am part of the order of Windrunners, men
        and women who use powers of gravity and magnetism to best their enemies and save innocents.</p>
